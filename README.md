# Testive-Messaging-Features
The Testive coaching program matches students with a tutor via Skype in order to supplement individual work done on its SAT/ACT practice web app. Since students only see their tutors once a week through a virtual medium, it's important to ensure that tutors are empowered to keep students accountable. When tutors log into their Testive accounts, they are presented with an inbox that allows them to use the Testive web app to communicate with students via text (the inbox is connected to the messaging service Twil.io). The inbox checklist pre-fills with students who need extra attention based on certain events that often reflect a decline in studies. For example, a student who has not completed 50% of his work or a student who hasn't had a tutoring session in 10 days present issues that the tutor should be able to resolve efficiently. When I managed our tutoring program, I noticed that there were other events that led to student failure, most notably a pattern of missing two study days in a row. I had little experience with coding, but I decided to extend out the inbox feature as a way to get my hands on a real-world problem. The inbox will include an event for all students who have missed two or more study days, regardless of whether they occured on consecutive calendar days. I really enjoyed working on a feature that I continue to use to this day with my own tutoring students.
